Hi, I’m Nicholas Chebat — an engineer turned technical product manager with a background in computer science and statistics.

I graduated from Harvard with a joint concentration in Computer Science and Statistics (cum laude, 3.8 GPA), with academic specialties in Data Science and Quantitative Finance. My work sits at the intersection of product, data, and engineering.

I currently work as a Technical Product Manager at TurboVets, where I’ve led mobile app launches, built scalable automation frameworks, architected eligibility engines, and shipped data-driven features end-to-end. Previously, I’ve built ML models for production use, developed full-stack financial analytics tools, and led engineering teams across product-focused projects.

If you’re working on something ambitious and impactful, I’m always open to collaborating.
